#### MEGA C++ SDK
<p>https://github.com/meganz/sdk</p>
<p>© 2013-2016 by Mega Limited, Auckland, New Zealand</p>
###### Description:
<p>MEGA --- The Privacy Company --- is a Secure Cloud Storage provider that protects your data thanks to end-to-end encryption. We call it User Controlled Encryption, or UCE, and all our clients automatically manage it.</p>
<p>All files stored on MEGA are encrypted. All data transfers from and to MEGA are encrypted. And while most cloud storage providers can and do claim the same, MEGA is different – unlike the industry norm where the cloud storage provider holds the decryption key, with MEGA, you control the encryption, you hold the keys, and you decide who you grant or deny access to your files.</p>
<p>This SDK brings you all the power of our client applications and let you create your own or analyze the security of our products.</p>
###### Usage:
<p>MEGAsync uses the MEGA C++ SDK to get all functionality that requires access to MEGA servers.</p>
